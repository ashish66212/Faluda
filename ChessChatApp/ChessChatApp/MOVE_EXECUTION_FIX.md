# Move Execution Fix - Engine First Move

## Problem Description

When the user selected "white" (meaning the engine plays as WHITE), the Android app would:
1. Send color selection to the backend
2. Receive response: `"Engine is white. First move: e2e4"`
3. **FAIL to execute the move on the board**
4. Wait for opponent move detection
5. Detect opponent's move (e.g., "g7h6")
6. Send it to the backend
7. Backend responds with `"Illegal move"` because e2e4 was never played

## Root Cause

The code only handled the case when the user chose "black" (engine plays as BLACK):

```kotlin
// OLD CODE - Only handled when color == "black"
if (color == "black" && isAutoPlayEnabled && responseBody.isNotEmpty()) {
    val movePattern = "[a-h][1-8][a-h][1-8][qrbn]?".toRegex()
    val engineMove = movePattern.find(responseBody)?.value
    if (engineMove != null) {
        executeMoveAutomatically(engineMove)
    }
}
```

When the user chose "white" (engine is WHITE and moves first), the move was never executed.

## Solution

Modified both `sendColorCommandAutomatic()` and `sendColorCommand()` functions to extract and execute ANY move from the backend response, regardless of color:

```kotlin
// NEW CODE - Handles both white and black
val movePattern = "[a-h][1-8][a-h][1-8][qrbn]?".toRegex()
val engineMove = movePattern.find(responseBody)?.value

if (engineMove != null && isAutoPlayEnabled && responseBody.isNotEmpty()) {
    addLog("sendColorCommandAutomatic", "Engine made first move: $engineMove")
    handler.post {
        executeMoveAutomatically(engineMove)
    }
}
```

## Workflow Now

### When User Selects "White" (Engine is WHITE):
1. Start game
2. Send color: "white"
3. Backend responds: `"Engine is white. First move: e2e4"`
4. **✅ App extracts "e2e4" and executes it on the board**
5. Wait for opponent move
6. Detect opponent move
7. Send to backend
8. Execute backend's response move
9. Repeat from step 5

### When User Selects "Black" (Engine is BLACK):
1. Start game
2. Send color: "black"
3. Backend responds: `"Engine is black. You are white. Make your move."`
4. Wait for opponent (user) to make first move
5. Detect opponent move
6. Send to backend
7. Backend responds with engine's move (e.g., "e7e5")
8. **✅ App extracts "e7e5" and executes it on the board**
9. Repeat from step 4

## Files Modified

- `app/src/main/java/com/chesschat/app/MoveDetectionOverlayService.kt`
  - `sendColorCommandAutomatic()` function (lines 471-519)
  - `sendColorCommand()` function (lines 581-654)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Engine plays WHITE: First move is executed automatically
- [x] Engine plays BLACK: User moves first, engine response executed
- [x] Move extraction works from various response formats
- [x] Auto-play checkbox must be enabled for automatic execution
- [x] Logs show "Engine made first move: [move]" for debugging

## Impact

This fix ensures the Android app stays synchronized with the backend chess game state, regardless of which color the engine plays. Without this fix, all subsequent moves would be rejected as "Illegal move" when the engine is white.

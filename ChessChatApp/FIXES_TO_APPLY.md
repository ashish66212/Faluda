## Issue 1: Color Logic Fix
**Problem**: App sends opposite color to backend (engine color instead of user color)
**Solution**: Send the SAME color that user selected

### Current Wrong Behavior:
```kotlin
val manualColor = if (isFlipped) "black" else "white"  // User picks white
val engineColor = if (manualColor == "white") "black" else "white"  // Calculate black
sendColorCommandAutomatic(engineColor)  // Send "black" ❌ WRONG
```

### Correct Behavior (What User Wants):
```kotlin
val manualColor = if (isFlipped) "black" else "white"  // User picks white  
sendColorCommandAutomatic(manualColor)  // Send "white" ✅ CORRECT
```

**User picks "white" → Send "white" to backend**
**User picks "black" → Send "black" to backend**

## Issue 2: Touch Simulation Not Working

**Problems**:
1. Tap-tap method unreliable
2. Touch duration too short (100ms)
3. No delay between taps
4. Coordinates might be slightly off

### Solutions:

#### Solution A: Increase Touch Duration & Add Delays
```kotlin
// Longer tap duration for better detection
performTouch(x, y, 250)  // Increased from 100ms to 250ms

// Longer delay between taps  
handler.postDelayed({ secondTap }, 400)  // Increased from 200ms to 400ms
```

#### Solution B: Use Drag Method Instead
Some chess apps work better with drag than tap-tap:
```kotlin
// Instead of: tap source -> wait -> tap destination
// Use: drag from source to destination
simulateDrag(fromX, fromY, toX, toY, 500)  // 500ms drag
```

#### Solution C: Add Touch Offset Variation
Add slight random offset to avoid detection by anti-cheat:
```kotlin
val offsetX = Random.nextInt(-5, 5)  // ±5 pixels
val offsetY = Random.nextInt(-5, 5)
val finalX = x + offsetX
val finalY = y + offsetY
```

#### Solution D: Try Multiple Touch Methods
If tap-tap fails, automatically retry with drag:
```kotlin
1. Try tap-tap (current method)
2. If fails, retry with single long press + drag
3. If still fails, report error
```

## Files to Modify:

1. **MoveDetectionOverlayService.kt**
   - Line 314-333: Remove engine color calculation, send user color directly
   - Line 1565-1593: Improve touch execution with longer durations and delays
   - Add fallback to drag method if tap-tap fails

2. **TouchSimulator.kt**
   - Line 35: Increase touch duration from 100ms to 250ms
   - Add retry logic with drag fallback

3. **ChessAccessibilityService.kt**  
   - Already looks good, no changes needed

## Expected Results After Fix:

### Color Logic:
- User selects "White" → Backend receives "white" ✅
- User selects "Black" → Backend receives "black" ✅

### Touch Simulation:
- More reliable move execution
- Works with more chess apps  
- Automatic fallback if one method fails
- Better timing and coordination

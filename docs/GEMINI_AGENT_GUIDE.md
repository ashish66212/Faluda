### AI Decision Making

The agent uses a sophisticated decision-making process:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Analyzes task requirements
   - Identifies information gaps
   - Creates step-by-step plan
   - Anticipates potential issues

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Gathers page context (buttons, forms, text)
   - Decides next actions based on current state
   - Executes browser commands
   - Monitors results

3. **Adaptation Phase**:
   - Detects errors or unexpected layouts
   - Adjusts strategy dynamically
   - Retries with different approach

### Available Browser Actions

```javascript
{
  "goto": { "url": "https://example.com" },
  "click": { "selector": "#button-id" },
  "type": { "selector": "#input-field", "text": "value" },
  "press": { "key": "Enter" },
  "scroll": { "direction": "down", "amount": 500 },
  "wait": { "seconds": 3 },
  "screenshot": { "name": "custom-name" },
  "extract_text": { "selector": ".content" },
  "evaluate": { "code": "document.title" }
}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Results

### During Execution

- **ngrok URL**: Remote access to control server
- **Real-time logs**: View in GitHub Actions console
- **Status endpoint**: `/status` - Current progress
- **Logs endpoint**: `/logs` - Full action history

### After Completion

**Artifacts** (automatically uploaded):
- **Screenshots**: Before/after each step
- **Videos**: Full browser session recording
- **Logs**: Detailed execution logs with timestamps

**Summary Report**:
- What was accomplished
- Key findings and results
- Issues encountered
- Final status

## üîß Configuration Options

### Model Selection

**gemini-2.0-flash-exp** (Recommended for speed):
- 2√ó faster than Gemini 1.5 Pro
- 1M token context window
- Best for production tasks

**gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp** (Recommended for complexity):
- Shows reasoning process
- Better for complex multi-step tasks
- Ideal for research and analysis

### Web Search

Enable for tasks requiring:
- Recent information
- Real-time data
- External research
- Fact verification

Disable for tasks like:
- Simple navigation
- Form filling with known data
- UI testing

## üéØ Best Practices

### Writing Effective Task Descriptions

**Good Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "Research top 5 AI tools launched in 2025 and summarize their features"
- ‚úÖ "Find the cheapest flight from New York to London next week"
- ‚úÖ "Extract all product names and prices from example-shop.com"

**Bad Examples**:
- ‚ùå "Do research" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Click button" (too specific, not autonomous)
- ‚ùå "Help me" (unclear objective)

### Safety Considerations

The agent will:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Log all actions for review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Request confirmation for sensitive operations (if needed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid destructive actions without clear intent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Respect website terms of service

**You should**:
- Review logs before running on production sites
- Test with sandbox/test environments first
- Monitor execution via ngrok URL
- Use headless=false for critical tasks (visual verification)

## üîê Security

- API keys stored in GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- Browser runs in isolated GitHub Actions runner
- Stealth mode prevents detection
- No data persistence after workflow ends

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't start
- Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set correctly
- Verify API key has sufficient quota
- Check if model name is valid

### Web search not working
- Ensure paid tier is enabled
- Verify `enable_web_search: true`
- Check API quota hasn't been exceeded

### Browser actions failing
- Review screenshots to see actual page state
- Check selector syntax (ID, class, CSS)
- Increase wait times for slow-loading pages
- Use `headless: false` to debug visually

### Task not completing
- Increase `timeout_minutes`
- Simplify task description
- Check logs for specific errors

## üìö Advanced Usage

### Custom Modifications

You can modify `autonomous-agent.js` to:
- Add custom browser actions
- Implement specialized extraction logic
- Integrate with other APIs
- Add custom validation rules

### Integration with Other Tools

The agent can be integrated with:
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Database storage for results
- Email reports
- Custom webhooks

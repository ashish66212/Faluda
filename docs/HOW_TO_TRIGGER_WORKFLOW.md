# How to Trigger Your Enhanced Gemini AI Workflow

## ‚úÖ Status

Your enhanced Gemini Autonomous AI Browser Agent workflow has been successfully uploaded to your GitHub repository!

**Repository**: `narayan662122-arch/Faluda`  
**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/gemini-browser-automation-enhanced.yml`

## üöÄ How to Trigger the Workflow Manually

Since this is a new `workflow_dispatch` workflow, GitHub requires you to trigger it manually for the first time. After the first run, you can trigger it via API.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
   - Visit: https://github.com/narayan662122-arch/Faluda

2. **Click on the "Actions" tab**
   - Located at the top of your repository page

3. **Select the workflow**
   - Look for "Gemini Autonomous AI Browser Agent" in the left sidebar
   - Click on it

4. **Click "Run workflow" button**
   - You'll see a button that says "Run workflow" on the right side
   - Click it to open the input form

5. **Configure the workflow inputs:**

   **Task Description** (required):
   - Example: "Navigate to google.com and search for GitHub Actions"
   - Example: "Research the top 5 AI news stories from this week"
   
   **Headless Mode**:
   - `false` (default) - You can see the browser in videos
   - `true` - Runs without visible browser (faster)
   
   **Timeout Minutes**:
   - `30` (default) - Maximum time for the workflow to run
   - Increase for complex tasks
   
   **Enable Web Search**:
   - `true` (default) - Enables Google Search grounding
   - `false` - Runs without web search (faster, but no external research)
   
   **Model Variant**:
   - `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` - Fast, production-ready
   - `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` (default) - Shows reasoning, better for complex tasks

6. **Click the green "Run workflow" button**

7. **Monitor the workflow**
   - The workflow will start running
   - You can see real-time logs by clicking on the running workflow
   - Look for the workflow run at the top of the list

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Secrets

Before running, make sure you have these secrets configured in your repository:

1. **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Your Google AI API key
   - Get it at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   
2. **NGROK_AUTHTOKEN**: For remote monitoring
   - Get it at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### How to Add Secrets:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/narayan662122-arch/Faluda
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions** (in left sidebar)
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add each secret:
   - Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Value: (your API key)
   - Name: `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`, Value: (your ngrok token)

## üìä After the Workflow Runs

The workflow will generate several artifacts:

1. **Screenshots**
   - Before and after each step
   - Download from the workflow summary page

2. **Videos**
   - Full recording of browser session
   - Shows exactly what the AI did

3. **Logs**
   - Detailed execution logs
   - Shows AI reasoning and decisions

All artifacts are available at the bottom of the workflow run page.

## ü§ñ What the Workflow Does

Your enhanced workflow is now a **fully autonomous AI agent** that:

1. **Analyzes** your task description
2. **Creates** a multi-step execution plan
3. **Researches** information using web search (if enabled)
4. **Executes** browser actions autonomously
5. **Adapts** if it encounters errors
6. **Reports** results with a structured summary

## üí° Example Tasks to Try

### Simple Task (Test Run):
```
Task: Navigate to google.com and take a screenshot
Headless: false
Web Search: false
Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
Timeout: 15 minutes
```

### Research Task:
```
Task: Research the latest developments in AI and create a summary with sources
Headless: false
Web Search: true
Model: gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp
Timeout: 30 minutes
```

### Data Collection:
```
Task: Find the top 5 trending GitHub repositories today and extract their names and descriptions
Headless: true
Web Search: true
Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
Timeout: 20 minutes
```

## üîß Programmatic Triggering (After First Run)

After you've manually triggered the workflow once, you can use the Python script to trigger it programmatically:

```bash
python trigger_and_monitor_workflow.py
```

This script will:
- Ask for task details
- Trigger the workflow via GitHub API
- Monitor execution in real-time
- Show you the results

Check out these files for more information:

- **GEMINI_AGENT_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive user guide with all features
- **ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md**: Detailed list of all enhancements made
- **github_repos.py**: Script to view your repositories (already working!)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Workflow doesn't appear in Actions
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to index the new workflow file
- Refresh the Actions page

### Workflow fails immediately
- Check that GEMINI_API_KEY and NGROK_AUTHTOKEN secrets are set
- Verify your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota

### Browser actions fail
- Check the screenshots to see what the page actually looks like
- Try with `headless: false` to debug visually
- Increase timeout if pages load slowly

### Web search not working
- Ensure you have a paid Gemini API tier (required for web search)
- Set `enable_web_search: true` in the inputs

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Add the required secrets** (GEMINI_API_KEY and NGROK_AUTHTOKEN)
2. **Trigger a test run** with a simple task
3. **Review the artifacts** (screenshots, videos, logs)
4. **Try more complex tasks** once you're comfortable

Enjoy your autonomous AI browser agent! ü§ñ‚ú®
